    "    - **Incorporates More Variables**: MLR can model the effect of multiple factors on the response variable, providing a more realistic and accurate representation of complex relationships.\n",

    "2. In **Simple Linear Regression**, the independent variable can be a **continuous variable** or an **indicator variable** (sometimes referred to as a binary or dummy variable). The key differences between these types of variables and their respective linear forms, are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A **continuous variable** is one that can take on an infinite number of values within a range, such as age, height, temperature, etc. When used as the independent variable in Simple Linear Regression, a continuous variable allows for modeling a linear relationship where changes in the continuous variable correspond to changes in the dependent variable. The theoretical model for a simple linear regression that uses a continuous predictor is:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        $$Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon_i \\text{ where } \\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$$\n",

    "        - $\\beta_1$: The slope of the linear regression\n",
    "        - $\\epsilon_i$: The variation or offset for each data (error term)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - An **indicator variable** is a categorical variable that has been transformed into a binary variable, usually taking values of 0 or 1. It is used to represent two categories or states (e.g., male/female, yes/no). In Simple Linear Regression, an indicator variable allows you to compare the mean value of the dependent variable between two groups or categories. The theoretical model for a simple linear regression that uses an indicator predictor is:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        $$Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 f(x_i) + \\epsilon_i \\text{ where } \\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$$\n",

    "        \n",
    "    - The key differences between these two linear forms is that in Simple Linear Regression with continuous predictor, the relationship is often modeled as a continuous change across a range of values, with $\\beta_1$ represents the rate of change in $Y_i$ per one unit of change in $x_i$. In Simple Linear Regression with indicator predictor however, the relationship is a discrete \"shift\" or change between two categories, with $\\beta_1$ represents the difference in the average value of $Y_i$ when $x_i$ is in the main group compared to when $x_i$ is in the other group.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    In the SLR model, all observations are assumed to follow the same linear trend. By adding the single indicator variable $z_i$ to the model, the model now accounts for two separate groups (or categories) for each data represented by the indicator variable, each with its own intercept but **shared slope** $\\beta_1$. This means that while the rate of change in both groups are the same, the intercept differs. This allows the model to account for systematic differences between the two groups while still capturing the linear effect of the continuous variable $x_i$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. When an **interaction** term between a continuous variable and an indicator variable in a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model is added, it allows the model to capture differences in the slope of the relationship between the continuous variable and the dependent variable across different categories defined by the indicator variable. This provides greater flexibility compared to a model without the interaction term, where the slope remains the same across all categories. The MLR model with this type of interaction term takes the form of:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\beta_2 f(z_i) + \\beta_3 (x_i \\cdot f(z_i)) + \\epsilon_i \\text{ where } \\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    with the definition:\n",
    "    - $x_i, z_i$: The predictors (independent variables)\n",
    "    - $f(z_i)$: A function with value $0$ if $z_i$ is the main group and $1$ if $z_i$ is the other group\n",
    "    - $Y_i$: The outcome (dependent variable)\n",
    "    - $\\beta_0$: The intercept **when $f(z_i) = 0$**\n",
    "    - $\\beta_1$: The slope of $x_i$ **when $f(z_i) = 0$**\n",
    "    - $\\beta_2$: The difference of intercepts from the two groups of $z_i$\n",
    "    - $\\beta_3$: The difference in the slope of relationship between $x_i$ and $Y_i$ from the two groups of $z_i$\n",
    "    - $\\epsilon_i$: The variation or offset for each data (error term)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    With the interaction term, the model also allows the slope of relationship between $x_i$ and $Y_i$ to be different for each group. This means that the rate of change of $Y_i$ per one unit of $x_i$ depends on the group that is represented by $z_i$. In this model, for the main group ($z_i = 0$), the intercept is $\\beta_0$ and the slope is $\\beta_1$. While for the other group ($z_i = 1$), the intercept is $\\beta_0 + \\beta_2$ and the slope is $\\beta_1 + \\beta_3$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<br />\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. When a **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** model is based solely on indicator **(dummy/binary) variables** derived from a non-binary categorical variable, it is designed to capture differences in the dependent variable across the categories of the original variable. This approach requires transforming the non-binary categorical variable into a set of binary indicator variables, often referred to as dummy variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The MLR Model with Indicator Variables described as above captures and models mean differences in the dependent variable across different categories. Each category of the original non-binary variable (except for one reference or baseline category) in this model is represented by an indicator variable that can take values of 0 or 1. For example, suppose a categorical variable $c$ with $k$ different categories (say, group $0, 1, 2, \\dots, k - 1$). Then, to include $c$ in the MLR, we create $k - 1$ **dummy variables** for group $1, 2, \\dots, k - 1$, which are $C_{1i}, C_{2i}, \\dots, C_{(k-1)i}$. This is to avoid **perfect multicollinearity** (known as the dummy variable trap) where the predictors would be linearly dependent. One category (in this case, it's group $0$) is treated as the reference or baseline category. The resulting model is:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $$Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 C_{1i} + \\beta_2 C_{2i} + \\dots + \\beta_{k-1} (C_{(k-1)i}) + \\epsilon_i \\text{ where } \\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    with the definition:\n",
    "    - $C_{1i}, C_{2i}, \\dots, C_{(k-1)i}$: The predictors (independent variables). Each predictor here has a value of $1$ if the category correspond to the variable and $0$ if otherwise (for example, $C_{2i} = 1$ if $c_i$ is group $2$, and $C_{2i} = 0$ if $c_i$ is any other group)\n",
    "    - $Y_i$: The outcome (dependent variable)\n",
    "    - $\\beta_0$: The intercept (mean of the reference category (group $0$))\n",
    "    - $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\dots, \\beta_k$: The coefficients for each predictor (difference of mean from reference category)\n",
    "    - $\\epsilon_i$: The variation or offset for each data (error term)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The resulting behavior of the model is that the model fits different intercepts for each category of the non-binary variable. These intercepts represent the mean of the dependent variable $y$ for each category. For example, the reference category (group $0$) has the average and intercept of $\\beta_0$, while another category, say group $2$, has the average and intercept of $\\beta_0 + \\beta_2$."

    "$R^2$ measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model.

    "The linear form specification in `model4_linear_form_CS` defines the mathematical relationship (such as interaction) between the dependent variable (HP) and the independent variables (predictors such as Attack, Defense, Speed, etc.). By centering and scaling some of the variables, this process standardizes the variables to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1, which helps in reducing issues like different scales between predictors and also can sometimes help with numerical stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we fit the model formula using `smf.ols()`, the model automatically constructs a design matrix. This is a matrix of input features where each column represents a transformed version of the original predictors (including the interactions). The shape of this matrix (`model4_spec.exog.shape`) tells how many predictors (including interactions) were generated and how many rows correspond to the given training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity occurs when two or more predictor variables are highly correlated. In your case, the interaction terms like `Attack * Defense`, `Attack * Speed`, and `Defense * Speed` might lead to high correlations between columns in the design matrix (`model4_spec.exog`). This can happen because many of the predictors (and interactions) are linearly related or nearly linearly related, which causes the columns of the design matrix to be linearly dependent or very close to linear dependence. This dependence increases the condition number of the design matrix, which is an indicator of numerical stability. A very high condition number, like 2,250,000,000,000,000, indicates that the matrix is near-singular, meaning the system of equations can't be solved reliably. This cause the model to inflates the variance of the coefficient estimates (i.e., the model is less stable), \n",
    "reduces the precision of the estimates for each predictor, and makes the model prone to overfitting, because the model starts fitting noise rather than genuine relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model fits highly correlated predictors too well, it essentially \"memorizes\" the training data, capturing even the noise. This leads to poor generalization because the model has become too tailored to the specifics of the training set. And the inflated variance due to multicollinearity makes the model overly sensitive to small changes in the input data. This causes instability when the model encounters unseen data (the test set).\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, due to multicollinearity, the model might fit too well with initial training data to the point that new unseen data might not fit too well in the model."

    "`model3_fit` is a Simple Linear Regression with two continuous predictors (`Attack` and `Defense`) without interaction and an outcome `HP`. `model4_fit` meanwhile, is a Complex Linear Regression with six continuous predictors (added `Speed`, `Legendary`, `Sp. Atk`, and `Sp. Def`) with interaction between every variable. This causes the number of parameters to grow rapidly, causing the model to overfit due to multicollinearity, resulting in poor fit for most unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`model5_linear_form` evolves (hehe) from `model3_fit` (and by extension, you can say it also evolves from `model4_fit`) by incorporating more continuous and categorical predictors from `model4_fit`. But, the difference is that it does not add interaction and instead just add more predictors to `model3_fit` additively. This model aims to provide a more nuanced explanation of `HP` by accounting for additional variables, helping to reduce bias and improve fit (even though the condition number is still 9210).\n",
    "\n",
    "`model6_linear_form` evolves from `model5_linear_form` by tuning some specific values in the categorical predictors (like the `normal` and `water` type in `Type 1` predictor). This approach allows the model to better capture the discrete shifts in `HP` based on Pokémon types or generations (i.e., types like Normal or Water may have distinctive patterns in HP). This also reduced the condition number to 618.\n",
    "\n",
    "`model7_linear_form` evolves from `model6_linear_form` by adding interaction terms into it. But, this had even worse multicollinearity like in `model4_fit` (condition number on 2.3 billion). So, for the ultimate evolution ( :3 ), the model `model7_linear_form_CS` uses scaling and centering for the continuous variables (`Attack`, `Speed`, `Sp. Def`, `Sp. Atk`) to address issues of variable scaling and to improve numerical stability, as evidenced by the improved condition number. This change helps in stabilizing the estimation process and reduces the risk of multicollinearity, especially with interaction terms."
