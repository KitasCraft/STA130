Since `WORK_hours_per_week` are most likely to be discrete, the author decided that bar chart is the most useful visualization/plots for distribution of number of working hours. Other visualization the author thinks might be useful is a scatterplot with x-axis being the number of working hours, and the y-axis being the ratio of `Yes` and `No` for `WELLNESS_burnout_direct`. This scatterplot can visualize the general image on whether the two variables are correlated in a way."

This can be done by assuming a population that adhere to null hypothesis ($H_0$) and doing repeated simulations by grabbing a sample with the same size as the original sample per simulation. After that, the author calculates the p-value by finding the ratio between number of simulations with sample that is more extreme than observed sample (in this case, $|xm_{yes} - xm_{no}|$ for each new sample is the same or larger than observed sample) and the total number of simulations. Then, the author compares whether p-value < $\\alpha$-significance to reject or fail to reject $H_0$."
